# fraude-detection
This project was a classification problem where i used a synthetic dataset generated using the simulator called PaySim as an approach to such a problem. PaySim uses aggregated data from the private dataset to generate a synthetic dataset that resembles the normal operation of transactions 

# The model i built able to detect fraudulent transactions with a very high accuracy using XGBoost classifier
